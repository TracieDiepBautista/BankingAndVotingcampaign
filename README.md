# Python_my_challenge
 - This is my very first projects using Python. 

1. Py_Bank_budget: 

    . what?: do Financial analysis to find out the Profit |Loss during entire period to see how changes are in each period. 
    . how?: use Python functions without Pandas (JupiterNote)

2. Py_Poll_voting_results
    
    . What: helping a State to find out who is the winner by counting the votes from citizens. Also have a comparison among 4 candidates.  
    . How: Python function without Pandas (JupiterNote)

Conclusion: with Pandas we can solve out the above projects quicker and easier but yet, this is likely a self challence if we want to :)
